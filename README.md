<h1>Parallel Quadtree</h1>

This project is meant to explore dynamic parallelism through the quadtree data structure. A quadtree geographically seperates a set of points by recursively splitting up a region of point until a set number of points occupy each leaf in the tree.

This structure is a good option for dynamic parallelism because each quadrant is independent.
